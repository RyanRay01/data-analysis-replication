### The purpose of this paper was to analyze the relationship between plant traits and ecosystem properties to see if plant traits could be used as predictors of ecosystem properties using linear mixed models and calculating marginal r^2 values of those models to investigate the proportion of variance explained by traits. The analysis focused on six plant functional traits as predictors of the ecosystem properties. There were two datasets used, which are saved as p and f in this code. Dataset P contains plot data with variables to be used as the ecosystem properties and dataset f contains the data regarding the plant functional traits for each plot. Dataset "f" contains two separate values for each trait "FD" and "FI", in my analysis I separated the values for each model as using both in each model led to more different results than the authors.

### Load in libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(lme4)
library(MuMIn)
library(MASS)
library(AICcmodavg)
library(broom)
library(stringi)
```

### Load in files
```{r}

### This was one of the included datasets and was used to calculate dataset "f" by the authors. 
f1 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanRay01/data-analysis-replication/main/data/traits.st.csv"
t <- read_csv(f1)

# This is the dataset containing the plot ecosystem functions
f2 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanRay01/data-analysis-replication/main/data/predictors_raw.csv"

p <- read_csv(f2)

head(p)

# This is the dataset containing the plot plant functional trait values.
f3 <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyanRay01/data-analysis-replication/main/data/functions4.st.csv"

f <- read_csv(f3)

head(f)

```

### Merging of f and p datsets so that there is a single coherent dataset
```{r}
### Give "f" arbitrary "seasons" so it can work with "p"
fe <- f %>% 
      filter(row_number() <= 2000) %>% 
      bind_rows(f)

seasons <- rep(c("spring", "summer"), times = nrow(fe)/2)

fe <- fe %>% mutate(season = c(seasons))

### Create joined dataset "d" by giving rows "plot IDs" and combining them

fe <- fe %>% mutate(Plot_ID = paste(fe$plot,fe$year,fe$season, sep = "_"))
pe <- p %>% mutate(Plot_ID = paste(p$plot,p$year,p$season, sep = "_"))

d <- merge(fe, pe, by = "Plot_ID") %>% subset(select=-c(plot.y,season.y,year.y)) %>%
  setnames( "plot.x", "PlotNum") %>%
  setnames( "year.x", "YearNum") %>%
  mutate(YearNum = as.factor(YearNum))
```

### Create lists of Ecosystem Properties and FI and FD trait names
```{r}

                  FD_fc, FD_sla, FD_lSize, FD_srr, FD_sd, FD_ssd, 
                  FD_leafN, FD_leafC, FD_Nacr, FD_cond, FD_lt, FD_pp, 
                  FD_lsd, FD_ldmc, FD_LCN, FD_rtd, FD_RCN, FD_sdmc,

### Discussion
```{r}
# One of the main challenges with replicating this analysis was the author calculated 2 metrics FD and FI for each trait but did not make it clear how these were handled in the creation of the models, or at the very least it was not apparent to me what they did. I was unable to recreate their results by separating the FD and FI values, but even when used both values for creating the models I was unable to achieve the same results. The authors got an average of .078 for their r^2 values, whereas I was only able to get an average of about .2 for both metrics. Despite this, I was able to get a similar right-skewed distribution as the original study. This was to be expected though, since the original authors found that traits were not a good indicator of ecosystem properties. Compared to the original study, I found that over 30 of the 42 ecosystem properties had less than 5% of their variance explained by their predictor variables. Only 4 properties had 5 - 10% of their variance explained using the FD metric, and about 7 using the FI. Using the FI metric I only had one property explained between 10-15% and about three using FD. The original study had about 26 properties from 0 - 5%, nine from 5-10%, four from 10-15%, two from 15-20%, and one from 20-25%. The difference from our results likely stemmed from me not understanding how they handled the FD and FI measurements, as well as some confusion on my part as to how and why they constructed their null model, which led to me using nulls based on each of the ecosystem properties.
